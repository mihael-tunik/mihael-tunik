\section{About me}
Programmer with versatile experience in IT and computer science.
I do believe that modern scientific research process requires significant programming skills.
Seeking a position as a developer-researcher to enhance my career growth.

\section{Education}
\cventry{2013~--- 2017}{Bachelor degree}{Saint-Petersburg}{Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University}{departament of applied mathematics and mechanics}{}
\cventry{2017~--- 2019}{Master degree}{Saint-Petersburg}{Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University}{departament of applied mathematics and mechanics}{}

\subsection{Master thesis}
\cventry{2019}{Special kernel density estimator for finite sample size conditions}{}{}{}{}
Work is dedicated to research of theoretical accuracy of statistical kernel density estimator of special type for finite sample size conditions.

\section{Experience: 4 years}
\cventry{august 2019~--- now}{Saint-Petersburg State University, Chebyshev Laboratory}{engineer-researcher}{}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Team work on developement of statistical instruments for geo-data analysis and seismic inversion. There we extensively used various Gaussian process based regression models (for example, multi-output GP or sparse GP) and various technics for data-processing. Also I helped with research for relevant scientific articles and automated several research pipelines. \newline

\item Development MVP for the tool for fine-tuning advanced hydrodynamic simulations in Dumux with Bayesian optimization techniques. Here I also was responsible for building custom UI with PyQt5. Among other things as a researcher I took part in implementing experimental software for solving Riemann problems, which appear in porous media hydrodynamics. \newline

\item Last but not least, I take part in local LMS maintaining/management, where my job responsibilities include system administator and devops tasks. \newline

\end{itemize}
