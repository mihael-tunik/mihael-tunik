\section{About me}
Programmer with versatile experience in IT and computer science.
I do believe that modern scientific research process requires significant programming skills (and ready to provide them).
Seeking a position as a developer-researcher to enhance my career growth.

\section{Education}
\cventry{2013~--- 2017}{Bachelor degree}{Saint-Petersburg}{Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University}{departament of applied mathematics and mechanics}{}
\cventry{2017~--- 2019}{Master degree}{Saint-Petersburg}{Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University}{departament of applied mathematics and mechanics}{}

\subsection{Master thesis}
\cventry{2019}{Special kernel density estimator for finite sample size conditions}{}{}{}{}
Work was dedicated to research of theoretical accuracy of statistical kernel density estimator of special type for finite sample size conditions.

\section{Experience: 4 years and 10 months}
\cventry{august 2019~--- now}{Saint-Petersburg State University, Chebyshev Laboratory}{engineer-researcher}{}{}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Here, I started as an intern in the small team, where we're developing statistical instruments for geo-data analysis and seismic inversion. 
There we extensively used various Gaussian process based regression models and various techniques for data-processing. \newline \newline
Typical tasks: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item research for relevant scientific articles;
  \item automate research pipeline;
  \item integrate and test new submodule in codebase; \newline
 \end{itemize}
\item Then, I continued to work as engineer-researcher on development the tool for fine-tuning advanced 
hydrodynamic simulations in Dumux with Bayesian optimization techniques.  
Among other things as a researcher I took part in implementing experimental software for solving Riemann problems. \newline \newline
Typical tasks: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item build custom desktop UI for our application (5K codebase from scratch);
  \item reorganize project codebase, fix architecture issues;
  \item rewrite algorithmic core for optimization; \newline
 \end{itemize}
\item Latest project, where I work mostly with ML-pipelines for classification/recognition timeseries data from sensors of gas-analyzer.
Developed baseline window-based approach for classification in combination with classic ML-tools like LDA/QDA or logistic regression. 
Took part in designing and implementation of multistaged classifier based on classic and gradient boosting models.
\newline \newline
Typical tasks: 
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Explore the data and develop strategies for handling it;
  \item Develop project research pipeline completely from scratch;
  \item Propose and develop different models for solving stated ML-problems; \newline
 \end{itemize}
\item Actually during my work I've created even more things: like microservices for convenient remote access to advanced simulator software
or gradio dashboards to make research process even more convenient. \newline
\end{itemize}
\section{Technical skills}
\hspace{10mm}Basically, I know three programming languages: \textbf{Python} and \textbf{C/C++}.
During my work experience, which is long enough, I encountered many more: SQL, Javascript, R and Matlab. \newline
I'm competent enough in fields of statistics and probability theory, linear algebra and calculus.
Studied in university and still didn't forget algorithms and numerical methods. \newline
In the latest projects I had a lot of practice with \textbf{statistical data analisys} and \textbf{ML} (hypothesis testing, 
binary/multiclass table data classification, linear models). \newline
 \begin{itemize}
 \item General purpose skills: \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many years of experience with different \textbf{Linux} distributions, system configuration, terminal (bash, Unix commands); \newline
        \item Proficient with \textbf{Git}, managing repositories: pull-requests,  \textbf{Github Actions} CI, reviews; \textbf{Notion} for task-tracking; \newline
        \item Remote access via \textbf{ssh}, familiar with \textbf{Docker} and \textbf{docker-compose}; \newline
        \item Extensive experience with \textbf{Python} toolchain and ecosystem: building up Python packages from scratch with \textbf{setuptools},
managing things with \textbf{venv} or \textbf{Anaconda}; \newline
        \item Testing with \textbf{pytest}, profiling with \textbf{cProfile} and \textbf{Sphinx} for automated documentation; \newline
    \end{itemize}    
 \item Experience as engineer-researcher:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Work on project sketches in \textbf{Jupyter Notebooks} and \textbf{Google Colab}; \newline
        \item Proficient with \textbf{numpy, scipy, sklearn}; very familiar with \textbf{Pandas and Polars} dataframe libs;
         work with GP models via GPflow, botorch, bayes\_opt, 
        gradient boosting with \textbf{CatBoost/LightGBM/XGBoost}; certain experience with Tensorflow, Keras and Torch; \newline
        \item Work with model ensembles, familiar with \textbf{model stacking} techniques; \newline
        \item Advanced \textbf{LaTeX} for scientific texts and presentations; \newline
    \end{itemize} 
 \item Some experience from desktop-dev:\newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item UI development with \textbf{PyQt5}, Qt Creator IDE, PyInstaller for bulding binaries; \newline
        \item Experience in writing detailed documentation for code and UI; \newline
    \end{itemize}
 \item Some experience from web-dev: \newline
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some experience from backend: 
          HTTP protocol, Nginx, \textbf{Flask}, Django, testing APIs with \textbf{Postman};\newline
        \item Basic experience with databases (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, SQLite) and key-value stores;\newline
        \item Some experience from frontend: HTML, CSS/SCSS, static site generators like Hugo and Javascript basics; \newline
    \end{itemize}
 \item Some experience with C/C++ (parallel computations with OpenMP, make-files and CMake, building small .so libs),
