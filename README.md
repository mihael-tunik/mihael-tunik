### Hi!
I'm engineer-researcher at Chebyshev lab. 
My main research interest includes probabilistic models, statistics and scientific computing.
Also I have a decent engineering experience and good knowledge of Python ecosystem.
Here's the article for the latest project I have worked on:
- _Classification of graphene-based electronic nose measurements with gradient-boosted decision trees_, [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092442472500929X);

Here's a list of OEIS sequences I've contributed to:
- OEIS A337663 (famous Stepping Stones puzzle): proposed lower bound for $a_{7}$, 
[link to my project](https://github.com/mihael-tunik/SteppingStonePuzzle);
- OEIS A052071 and A052072 (cubes with special digit properties): computed $a_{8}$,
